## ðŸ”— Dataset

This project uses a private image dataset (~700 images).  
To run the code:

1. Download the dataset from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VtW8dB1ru4QY1O1aw2skS9j_eg44t-zR?usp=sharing.
2. Place the downloaded "raw" folder which contains all images inside the `data` folder.
3. Do **not** push this folder â€” it is ignored via `.gitignore`.
